### Setting Values

You can set the datetime field type value with a timestamp.

    $entry->example = date("U");

You can also use any string interpretable by the `strtotime` method.

    $entry->example = "now";

    $entry->example = "+2 days";

Lastly, you can also set the value with an instance of `Carbon`.

    $entry->example = new Carbon;
